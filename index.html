        <h2>Endangered Animals</h2>
        
        <p>Hello and welcome! This website is dedicated to the preservation and conservation of endangered species, providing comprehensive information, awareness, and resources related to these vulnerable animals.</p>
        
        <p>In the 1900s, the government enacted the Lacey Act of 1900, a legislative measure designed to combat illegal trafficking of wilflife, fish, or plants. During the 1960s and 1970s, researchers identifited a discernible trend of population decline among certain animal species. One of the initial species to be classifed as endangered was the passenger pigeon, scienficially referred to as Ectopistes migratorius. The jeopardization of numerous species can be ascribed to factors such as natural disasters and hunting activities. Presently, the Javan Rhino is the number 1 animal that is critially endangered with only 75 population.</p>
